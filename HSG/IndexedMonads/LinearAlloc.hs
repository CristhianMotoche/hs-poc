   What we want to do:
   1) Open file handles
   2) And close them exactly ONCE

   How?
   1) Track whether a file handle is open or closed
   2) We'll keep the open ones in a list and we'll remove then once closed
   3) We'll use a increasing NAT to keep unique kyes for the file handles

{-
  (1) `s` is used with the ST trick
  (2) unsafeRunLinear is unsafe in two ways:
  - lets us run arbitarry Linear computations, including incomplete ones
  - doesn't existentialize `s`, meaning a file handle can leak out of it

{-
  (1) It can be used for any `next` and `open`
  (2) the postconditions of `openFile` is that `next` is incremented
  (3) and insert `next` into the `open` set
